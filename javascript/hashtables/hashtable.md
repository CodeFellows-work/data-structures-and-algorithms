# Hashtables
A hash table is a data structure that is used to store keys/value pairs. 

## Challenge

Arguments: key, value

Returns: nothing

This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.


* ### get
Arguments: key

Returns: Value associated with that key in the table


* ### contains
Arguments: key

Returns: Boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.


* ### hash
Arguments: key

Returns: Index in the collection for that key
